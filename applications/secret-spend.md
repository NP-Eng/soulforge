# Secret Spend

## Project Information

-  **Project Name:** Secret Spend

-  **Payment Details:** Provide your wallet address for USDC (on Polygon Network).

-  **Total Amount Requested:** 12,000 USDC


## Project Overview :page_facing_up:  

**Brief Description:**

Secret Spend is a confidential payment protocol that effortlessly merges privacy with transactions, utilizing cutting-edge cryptographic methods. By employing Zero Knowledge Proofs and Plonky3 technology, it transforms the landscape of financial confidentiality, guaranteeing that your account balance remains concealed while securely executing fund transfers.
  

**Core Idea:**

Secret Spend is an innovative Private Payments Protocol that effectively marries privacy with transaction capabilities, employing sophisticated cryptographic methodologies. By harnessing the power Plonky3, it transforms the landscape of financial confidentiality, ensuring that your account balance remains concealed while facilitating secure fund transfers.

At the core of our user-friendly interface lies a formidable cryptographic framework, which guarantees that every transaction is a secure and private interaction. This system not only prioritizes user anonymity but also enhances the overall security of your financial dealings.

**Key Features of Secret Spend**
- **Plonky3 Technology**: Enhances transaction speed and efficiency while maintaining privacy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, making secure transactions accessible to everyone.


 **Technology Stack:**

- Frontend: NextJs
- Backend: Golang(api)
- Smart contract: Solidity
- Prover circuit: Plonky3
  

## Ecosystem Fit  

 **Similar Projects:**

There exists the famous Tornado Cash, which is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency mixing service that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to obscure the origins of their cryptocurrency transactions, enhancing privacy by pooling deposits and allowing withdrawals to different addresses without a direct link to the original deposit.
  

 **Unique Contribution:**

 - Secret Spend uses Plonky3 to maintain user anonymity while facilitating secure fund transfers.

 - Tornado Cash functions primarily as a coin mixer, allowing users to deposit and withdraw funds through multiple addresses to break transaction links. In contrast, Secret Spend **focuses on integrating privacy directly into payment protocols rather than solely mixing transactions**.
